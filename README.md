# Hack4HumanityProject

The goal for our project was to create a centralized location for volunteering positions that non-profits and other disaster relief organizations can post. In this way, instead of having to know specific organizations, you can post your city location and find organizations with volunteer positions just for you! However, if you do know of a specific organization name, you can search it and find volunteer positions that they've posted. 

You begin at index.html, which can take you to one of three pages: about.html, hack_postjob, hack_pre_home (search).

Also, the files beginning with "relief_project" are older versions and ideas we had for our website.
